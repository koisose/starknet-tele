# STARKNET AI BOT

video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MccMGa33IQ
telegram bot demo: https://web.telegram.org/k/#@starknetai_bot

Some of the things that my bot is capable of now:
1. search - to search starknetjs.com documentation
2. transfer - to transfer token between starknet address
3. list of transaction - to list a transaction of particular address
4. list token - list all the token you can swap on avnu sorted from verified
5. balance - check balance of particular address only sepolia for now
6. swap - swap between token powered by AVNU
7. transaction detail - see detail of transaction

basically this bot will try to understand if your query is about search, transfer, balance, or anything that listed above, you triggering it by putting the word above in your query, for example "search what is starknet" or "please search for me what is starknet" this two query will share similar result even though different sentence
